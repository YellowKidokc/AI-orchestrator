# Sample Project Context

The client is exploring the design of "AionOS", an AI multi-agent orchestration system. They want a high-level overview of how agents collaborate, evaluate each other, and maintain logs for future learning.

The goal for this cycle is to draft a concise overview explaining the system's workflow and highlighting how performance tracking and self-evaluation support continuous improvement.
